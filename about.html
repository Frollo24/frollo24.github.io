          <h1>Creativity</h1>
          <p>
            I consider myself a creative and restless person. I always come up
            with new project ideas and I enjoy developing my own ideas. It feels
            like letting your imagination create a new world in real life. This
            gives me a lot of motivation which I can use for always have something
            in hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why I also love learning everything I can. Every time I propose
            myself a challenge and achieve it, I feel very proud of myself, which
            takes me to continue working hard on my projects. That's another reason
            why I chose to be a developer, because you can always learn something new.

          <h1>Videogames</h1>
          <p>
            I love developing videogames and interactive applications. I usually
            don't play videogames a lot, but I like relaxing playing videogames.
            Some of my favorite videogames are Minecraft, Pokémon (the old ones),
            Temtem, Brawlhalla, Monster Hunter, Fire Emblem, Golden Sun...
          </p>
          <p>
            I generally enjoy random-based videogames (Moonlighter, Soul Knight,
            ReDungeon), survival videogames (Minecraft, The Forest, Ark...) and
            creature collecting videogames (Pokémon, Temtem, Invizimals...), and
            those games inspire me when I develop game ideas.

          <h1>Colors</h1>
          <p>
            Another thing which gets my interest is the light, and one of its
            properties that I like the most is the color. I get very excited when
            I see a triangle with rainbow colors which I programmed showing up
            in a window. From there, I enjoy researching about color spaces,
            high-dynamic range images, bloom effects...
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why I also like photography, color theory, optics and optometry.
            I like playing with the camera settings and get stunning pictures of
            both nature and people.

          <h1>Going outside</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a very active person, and I feel very connected with nature too.
            Sometimes I like going for a walk across the field or (if I have the
            opportunity) across a forest. Forests are the places I like the most
            when I want to go for a walk and chill in a peaceful place.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also focused on leading a healthy lifestyle; in order to achieve
            that goal I usually do some workouts which consists of both fitness
            and calisthenics. I think this two workout styles connect really well
            with my relationship with nature.
