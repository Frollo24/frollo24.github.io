          <h1>Skills</h1>
          <p>
            To classify my skills, I've come up with a method to determine my level
            of expertise in each of the technologies I have used throughout my
            professional career, which consists of a 1 to 5 star rating with the
            following meaning:
          </p>
          <br>
          <table id="table_legend">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th class="tabletitle" colspan="2">Legend</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td class="skill-level">5</td>
                <td>
                  I consider myself an expert with this technology. I can always
                  improve, but I feel very comfortable using this technology in
                  a project.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="skill-level">4</td>
                <td>I've used this technology several times and I can do advanced stuff with it.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="skill-level">3</td>
                <td>
                  I know some intermediate things about this technology, so I
                  could manage a little project myself.
