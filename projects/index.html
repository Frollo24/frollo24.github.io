          <h1>Projects</h1>
          <p>
            In this section I show some of the projects that I've done related to
            game development or computer graphics, as these are the areas where
            I stand out the most. This page is divided in three categories: skills
            (where I explain briefly how I classify my ability with each technology),
            computer graphics and videogames (showing some of the projects I've
            done in each category respectively).

          <h1>Skills</h1>
          <p>
            To classify my skills, I've come up with a method to determine my level
            of expertise in each of the technologies I have used throughout my
            professional career, which consists of a 1 to 5 star rating with the
            following meaning:

                  I consider myself kind of an expert with this technology. I
                  can always improve, but I feel very comfortable using this one
                  in a project.

          <p>
            Despite having a bachelor's degree in Videogame Design and Development,
            the area where I have specialized the most is computer graphics. That's
            why most of my projects are related to this subject: render engines,
            custom shaders, pathtracers...

          <h1>Videogames</h1>
          <p>
            When I've made videogames within a team, the role I generally assumed
            within the project has been the role of programmer/developer. For this
            reason, almost all videogame projects that I show here are centered
            on code quality.

          <p>
            There are some other projects that I've also done during both my
            bachelor degree and my free time. If you are interested in any of the
            projects, you can go to the page linked below to see all the projects
            I've developed. Feel free to check and use the source code of the
            project if it's available.
