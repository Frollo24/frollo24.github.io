          <h1>Who am I?</h1>
          <p>
            My name is Adrian, I'm a 23 year old videogame and 3D rendering
            enthusiast. I have a degree in Videogame Design and Development at
            at Rey Juan Carlos University, Spain. I'm also finishing a master
            degree in Computer Graphics, Games and Virtual Reality at the same
            university.
          </p>
          <p>
            My main interests are game development, engine development and
            computer graphics. For my Bachelor Thesis I've developed a render
            engine using OpenGL as the main API with the ability of rendering
            PBR materials and for my Master Thesis I'm developing a neural network
            that predicts the global illumination of a scene.

            As I mentioned before, I'm a computer graphics enthusiast. Although
            my BT render engine is done with OpenGL as the main API, I have also
            developed some render engines using Vulkan as the main API. Furthermore,
            I have some experience with Mitsuba 3 having used it as the pathtracer
            for data generation in my MT project.

            Videogames have interested me since I was born. When I was a child,
            I really enjoyed playing videogames, drawing videogame elements and
            creating stories. I also love technology, so when I grew up, I decided
            to learn programming and make my dreams come true.

          <h1>Artist, kind of</h1>
          <p>
            I like art, and I like drawing, but I'm not as enthusiastic as I am
            with programming. When I have some free time, I like to put my artistic
            skills into practice, which mainly involves pixelart in 2D art and
            material design in 3D modeling software (mainly Blender) in 3D art.

            I don't like social media very much. I only use social networks in
            order to talk with near friends, but I plan using social media when
            I can make my own indie game developments. Meanwhile, if you want to
            contact me, you can send me a message via <a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/adri%C3%A1n-salgado-jimeno-2771a3233">LinkedIn</a>,
            or you can use the <a href="/contact.html">contact</a> page.
